This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: a blank screen despite seemingly correct route configuration. The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version, highlighting the solution and explaining the cause of the problem.  The issue arises from a missing `element` prop in the Route component, or other configuration issues.
